# Project Description
    This forms part of the certification projects for JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures offered by freeCodeCamp https://gitlab.com/https://www.freecodecamp.org . For this project, I decided to build a Cash Register for the _zer011 restuarant. The user,cashier, enters the amount that a customer pays with for a particular product whose price is specified. Depending on how much customer paid with, the cashier will either be presented with the change the customer deserves or get an alert that the amount is less than the price.

# Stack
    To accomplish this project, I used:
        1)HTML
        2)CSS
        3)JavaScript
    and:
        1)Visual Studio Code as a tool to write the code
    For learning purposes, I am looking forward to rewrite the project using the following stack:
        1)ReactJS
        2)TailwindCSS
        3)TypeScript
# Folder Structure
    The folder structure is as follows:

            -CashRegister (i.e contains the image used as the background)
                -index.html (i.e The markup document)
                -readMe.md  (i.e The CURRENT file you are in)
                -script.js  (i.e Javascript code is written in here)
                -style.css  (i.e The stylesheet)
